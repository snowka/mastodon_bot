# mastodon_bot
A python script for posting toots to Mastodon.

This is the script for a Mastodon bot called the Charles Gildon Snarkbot, which posts quotes from the eighteenth-century dramatist, author, poet, and 
critic attacking his contemporaries, as well as comments that they made about him. This uses Mastodon.py and the Schedule library to post toots 
at a pre-determined rate. 

The basic approach is indebted to this example: https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/08/easy-guide-to-building-mastodon-bots/
